abstract: "The apparatus of an edge computing node, a system, a method and a machine-readable medium. The apparatus includes a processor to perform rounds of federated machine learning training including: processing client reports from a plurality of clients of the edge computing network; selecting a candidate set of clients from the plurality of clients for an epoch of the federated machine learning training; causing a global model to be sent to the candidate set of clients; and performing the federated machine learning training on the candidate set of clients. The processor may perform rounds of federated machine learning training including: obtaining coded training data from each of the selected clients; and performing machine learning training on the coded training data."
