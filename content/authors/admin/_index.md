Hi, I am a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="http://publish.illinois.edu/milenkovic/">Prof. Olgica Milenkovic's</a> at the <a href="https://illinois.edu/"> University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a>. Previously, I completed my MS and PhD degrees in the <a href="https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/">Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/"> University of Southern California</a>, working under the guidance of <a href="https://www.avestimehr.com/">Prof. Salman Avestimehr</a> in the <a href="https://www.avestimehr.com/vital-lab">Information Theory and Machine Learning (vITAL)</a> research lab. During my research pursuits, I have also collaborated closely with <a href="https://annavar.am/">Prof. Murali Annavaram</a>, <a href="https://hal.usc.edu/chugg/">Prof. Keith Chugg</a>, and <a href="https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~ramtin/">Prof. Ramtin Pedarsani</a>. I have also had the fortune to gain industry experience through multiple internships. I spent Summer 2018 and Summer 2019 as a Research Intern at Intel Labs under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=plidYfUAAAAJ">Dr. Shilpa Talwar</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=frmNZH4AAAAJ">Dr. Nageen Himayat</a> respectively. During Summer 2021, I was an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon Alexa AI under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=wBkmDegAAAAJ">Dr. Clement Chung</a> and <a href="https://guptarah.github.io/">Dr. Rahul Gupta</a>. Prior to joining the graduate school, I completed my BTech in 2016 in <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/">Electrical Engineering</a> from the <a href="https://iitk.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a>, where I worked under <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~adityaj/">Prof. Aditya K. Jagannatham</a>, in the <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/mwn/">Multimedia Wireless Networks (MWN)</a> Group.

Outside research, I like hanging out with friends, watching classical Bollywood movies, and listening to Indian classical music.
